# Preliminary

Kudos where it is due, I got the idea of structuring my paper reading from https://github.com/fregu856/papers#uncertainty-estimation. 
He has a bunch of nice summaries and annotated pdfs, so do check it out. 
I will follow a similar approach yet more focused on summarizing for future use and related usefulness to my own research. 

I hope it benefits whoever is checking out my repository ;) 
Any remarks or comments, you can always launch an issue! 

Cheers, 

Jordy
